/**
 * Implementation of core "special" functions that implement
 * control-flow and other essential operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * Not all special functions are implemented here, these are the most frequently
 * used and those that do not need complicated argument matching and so can be
 * implemented as simple subclasses of {@link r.lang.SpecialFunction}
