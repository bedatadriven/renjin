Description: This package consists of two main functions. The first
        function is corAspect() performs optimal scaling by maximizing
        an aspect (i.e. target function such as sum eigenvalues, sum of
        squared correlations, squared multiple correlations, etc.) of
        the corresponding correlation matrix. The second function is
        lineals() which performs optimal scaling by mimimization a
        non-correlational aspect based on pairwise correlations and
        correlation ratios. The resulting correlation matrix and
        category scores can be used for further multivariate methods
        such as SEM. A platform including related PsychoR packages is
        provided on R-Forge.
