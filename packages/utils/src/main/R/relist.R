# relist.R -- an inverse operator to unlist

# Some functions need many parameters, which are most easily represented in
# complex structures.  Unfortunately, many mathematical functions in R,
# including optim, nlm, and grad can only operate on functions whose domain is
# a vector.  R has a function called "unlist" to convert complex objects into a
# vector representation.  This file provides an inverse operation called
# "relist" to convert vectors back to the convenient structural representation.
# Together, these functions allow structured functions to have simple
# mathematical interfaces.
#
# For example, a likelihood function for a multivariate normal model needs a
# variance-covariance matrix and a mean vector.	 It would be most convenient to
# represent it as a list containing a vector and a matrix.  A typical parameter
# might look like
#
#	list(mean=c(0, 1), vcov=cbind(c(1, 1), c(1, 0)))
#
# However, optim can't operate on functions that take lists as input; it
# only likes vectors.  The solution is conversion:
#
## 	initial.param <- list(mean=c(0, 1), vcov=cbind(c(1, 1), c(1, 0)))
## 	initial.param <- as.relistable(initial.param)
## #
## 	ll <- function(param.vector)
## 	{
## 		param <- relist(initial.param)
## 		-sum(dnorm(x, mean=param$mean, vcov=param$vcov, log=TRUE))
## 		# note: dnorm doesn't do vcov... but I hope you get the point
## 	}

## 	optim(unlist(initial.param), ll)
#
# "relist" takes two parameters: skeleton and flesh.  Skeleton is a sample
# object that has the right "shape" but the wrong content.  "flesh" is a vector
# with the right content but the wrong shape.  Invoking
#
#	relist(flesh, skeleton)
#
# will put the content of flesh on the skeleton.  You don't need to specify
# skeleton explicitly if the skeleton is stored as an attribute inside flesh.
# In particular, flesh was created from some object obj with
#
#	unlist(as.relistable(obj))
#
# then the skeleton attribute is automatically set.
#
# As long as "skeleton" has the right shape, it should be a precise inverse
# of unlist.  These equalities hold:
#
#	relist(unlist(x), skeleton) == x
#	unlist(relist(y, skeleton)) == y
#
#	x <- as.relistable(x)
#	relist(unlist(x)) == x
